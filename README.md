Candidate: **Neel Kothari (neelk07@gmail.com)**

![Demo](http://g.recordit.co/QQjwMVK7MD.gif)

## Running Code
You can install all the dependencies and start the development server by running `npm install && npm start`. Then you should be able to access the app at [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/)

## Open Source Tools & Libraries
Besides React and Redux, I used Immutable, Lodash, [Moment](https://momentjs.com), and [react-modal](https://github.com/reactjs/react-modal). I also used [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/) which is a super simple, boilerplate CSS library that provides basic styling for elements.

## Bonus Points Attempted
1. **Ability to save appointments for future months**
2. ~~Ability to specify time of day on appointment~~
3. ~~Multi day appointments~~
4. ~~Use of functional programming~~
5. **Use of Redux**
6. **CSS modules**
7. ~~Custom webpack config~~
8. ~~Responsive design~~
